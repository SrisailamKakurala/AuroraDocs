Thanks for the update! I'll incorporate the app name **Aurora-Docs** into the documentation. Below is the revised version with the app name updated in the description, uniqueness/novelty, business/social impact, tech stack, and scope of work sections.

---

### Description
The **Aurora-Docs** is an innovative AI-driven academic assistant designed to empower students and faculty by enabling seamless interaction with documents (PDFs, DOCX) and text inputs. Leveraging advanced AI models (e.g., Gemini, IBM Granite), the app offers a suite of features including single and multi-document chat with text/speech input, automated notes generation with customizable summarization, mindmap creation, question paper and flashcard generation, note translation, and lesson plan development for educators. Built with ReactJS for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, it provides a user-friendly interface and scalable microservices architecture to support diverse academic needs, from revision to teaching preparation.

### Uniqueness/Novelty
- **Integrated Academic Ecosystem**: Aurora-Docs combines document processing, chat, and content generation (notes, mindmaps, question papers) into a single platform, unlike fragmented tools.
- **Multi-Document Contextual Chat**: Unique ability to consolidate answers from multiple documents, addressing overlapping content—an advancement over single-doc chatbots in Aurora-Docs.
- **Customizable Notes and Exports**: Offers multiple summarization modes (executive, detailed, cheat-sheet) and export options (PDF, DOCX, Markdown), tailored to user preferences within Aurora-Docs.
- **Faculty-Centric Tools**: Lesson plan generation with export to PPT/PDF stands out as a specialized feature for educators in Aurora-Docs.
- **Speech and Multilingual Support**: Incorporates speech-to-text and translation, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in education through Aurora-Docs.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern UI, supporting theming (light/dark mode) and profile management in Aurora-Docs.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for RESTful APIs, ensuring high performance and async processing for Aurora-Docs.
- **AI Models**: 
  - Current: IBM Granite-3.1-1B-A400M-Instruct (via Hugging Face) for text generation, HuggingFaceEmbeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings in Aurora-Docs.
  - Planned: Gemini or other LLMs for additional generation capabilities in Aurora-Docs.
- **Microservices (Current and Planned)**:
  - **DocProcessor-service**: Extracts text from PDFs/DOCX (using PyPDF2, python-docx) for Aurora-Docs.
  - **Embedder-service**: Chunks and embeds text, stores in Redis (using LangChain, sentence-transformers) for Aurora-Docs.
  - **RAG-service**: Retrieves and generates responses (using transformers, Redis) for Aurora-Docs.
  - **Planned**: 
    - **NotesGenerator-service**: Creates structured notes with summarization for Aurora-Docs.
    - **MindmapGenerator-service**: Converts notes to visual mindmaps for Aurora-Docs.
    - **QuestionPaper-service**: Generates quizzes, flashcards, and exam papers for Aurora-Docs.
    - **Translation-service**: Handles multilingual note conversion for Aurora-Docs.
    - **LessonPlan-service**: Produces educator lesson plans for Aurora-Docs.
- **Database**: Redis for temporary vector storage with TTL, scalable with clustering for Aurora-Docs.
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture enables horizontal scaling with Docker/Kubernetes, GPU support for AI models, and load balancing for high user traffic in Aurora-Docs.
- **Additional Tools**: 
  - Speech-to-text: Web Speech API or libraries like SpeechRecognition for Aurora-Docs.
  - Export: Libraries like reportlab (PDF), python-docx (DOCX) for Aurora-Docs.
  - DevOps: Git for version control, CI/CD pipelines for Aurora-Docs deployment.
