Great! Designing a scalable, microservices-based backend architecture for your **Doc Intelligence App** with FastAPI and the mentioned technologies is a solid approach. Here's a detailed plan and design to get you started.

---

## 1. **High-Level Microservices Architecture**

Your app has multiple distinct features that can be naturally separated into microservices. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific domain or functionality.

### Suggested Microservices:

| Service Name           | Responsibility                                                                 | Tech Stack / Notes                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway**       | Single entry point for frontend, routes requests to appropriate microservices. | FastAPI + API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Traefik)|
| **Auth Service**      | User authentication, profile management, JWT token issuance.                   | FastAPI, OAuth2, JWT, Redis (session store)|
| **Document Service**  | Upload, store, and manage documents (PDF, DOCX, text).                         | FastAPI, AWS S3 for storage, Redis caching |
| **Chat Service**      | Single & multi-document chat, speech recognition integration.                  | FastAPI, LangChain, IBM Granite, HuggingFace models |
| **Notes Service**     | Notes generation, storage, and Q&A with notes.                                | FastAPI, LangChain, Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone, Redis) |
| **Mindmap Service**   | Mindmap generation and visualization data preparation.                         | FastAPI, AI models for concept extraction  |
| **Question Paper Service** | Generate quizzes, flashcards, exam papers.                                  | FastAPI, AI models                          |
| **Translation Service** | Translate notes into multiple languages.                                     | FastAPI, HuggingFace translation models    |
| **Lesson Plan Service** | Generate structured lesson plans.                                            | FastAPI, AI models                          |
| **Export Service**    | Export notes, Q&A, lesson plans to PDF/DOCX/Markdown.                          | FastAPI, PDF/DOCX libraries                 |
| **Notification Service** | Email, push notifications, alerts.                                           | FastAPI, external email/push services       |

---

## 2. **Inter-Service Communication**

### Communication Patterns:

- **Synchronous (HTTP/REST or gRPC):**  
  For request-response interactions, e.g., frontend calls API Gateway → routes to Chat Service → returns response.

- **Asynchronous (Message Queue):**  
  For long-running or decoupled tasks, e.g., Notes generation, exporting documents, or notifications. Use message brokers like **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, or **AWS SQS**.

### Example Flow:

- Frontend → API Gateway → Chat Service (sync HTTP)
- Chat Service → Notes Service (async via message queue for heavy processing)
- Notes Service → Export Service (async)
- Services use **Redis** for caching and shared state (e.g., session, rate limiting).

## 3. **Data Storage**

| Data Type           | Storage Solution                  | Notes                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| User Data           | Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) | Auth service manages user profiles     |
| Documents           | AWS S3                          | Store raw files, scalable and durable  |
| Generated Notes, Mindmaps, Flashcards | Vector DB (Pinecone, Redis Vector Store) | For semantic search and Q&A            |
| Metadata & Logs     | NoSQL DB (MongoDB/DynamoDB)    | For flexible document metadata         |
| Cache & Session     | Redis                          | Fast caching, session management       |

---

## 4. **AI Model Integration**

- Use **LangChain** as orchestration layer for LLMs and chains.
- Models hosted on:
  - **HuggingFace** (via API or self-hosted)
  - **IBM Granite** (via API)
  - **Gemini** (if available via API)
- Each AI-related microservice will call these models as needed.
- Consider **model caching** and **rate limiting** to optimize costs.

---

## 5. **Authentication & Authorization**

- Centralized **Auth Service** issuing JWT tokens.
- API Gateway validates tokens and forwards user info to downstream services.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for faculty vs students.

---

## 6. **Deployment & Scaling**

- Containerize each microservice with **Docker**.
- Use **Kubernetes (EKS on AWS)** for orchestration and scaling.
- Use **AWS S3** for document storage.
- Use **Redis** as a managed service (AWS Elasticache).
- Use **AWS RDS** for relational DB.
- Use **CloudWatch/Prometheus/Grafana** for monitoring and logging.

---

## 7. **How to Start**

### Step 1: Define APIs & Contracts
- Design OpenAPI specs for each microservice.
- Define request/response schemas and error handling.

### Step 2: Setup Core Infrastructure
- Setup AWS S3 bucket.
- Setup Redis instance.
- Setup relational DB.
- Setup message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka).

### Step 3: Build Core Microservices
- Start with **Auth Service** and **API Gateway**.
- Build **Document Service** for file upload and storage.
- Build one AI service (e.g., Chat Service) integrating LangChain + LLMs.

### Step 4: Integrate Frontend
- Connect frontend to API Gateway.
- Test end-to-end flows.

### Step 5: Add Other Services Incrementally
- Notes Service → Mindmap → Question Paper → Translation → Lesson Plan → Export.

### Step 6: Add Async Processing & Messaging
- Move heavy tasks to async queues.
- Add notification service.
